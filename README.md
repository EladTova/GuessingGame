# GuessingGame

The attached implemented code is my code logic implementation for the guessing game.
The game will end once the player will guess all the missed characters of the raffled sentence.
For every correct guess the player will get 5 points.
For every incorrect guess the playerâ€™s score will drop by one point.
If the player will succeed in guessing all the required characters in less than 30 seconds he will get a 100 points bonus.
